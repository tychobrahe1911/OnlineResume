1. DEFINE THE PROJECT------------------------

    1. Define who the website is for
        potential employer

    2. Define what the website is for
        My goal: to build more interest by prospective employers

    3. Define target audience
        Employers looking for a .Net Developer

2. PLAN THE PROJECT------------------------

    1. Gather website content(content.md)
        images
        wording

    2. Plan out the sitemap
        Home page with other pages

    3. Define website personality
        Based on the target audience being tech centered and to product being food
        we will go with the Startup/Upbeat personality. Since the product is about
        consumer well being we can add some Calm/Peaceful personality elements as well

    4. Plan sections for pages(see ## Sections in content.md)

Investing in Myself
    Learning new coding skills. I make it a habit to learn/practice new software skills every day. The last couple of years I have been especially interested
    in building websites.

    Exercising at the YMCA 5 days a week. I enjoy strenuous 45 to 55 minute sessions with a mix of weight lifting and cardio work.

    Constantly analyzing the world around me to gain understanding and give myself perspective.
